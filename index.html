            <p>Shortly after lunch, you - a first lieutenant - leave the dining facility for the parking lot. As you walk to your car, you see your friend who was 
                recently promoted to captain (a captain outranks a first lieutenant) along with a few other enlisted members. As you approach, you greet with a salute.
                As you salute, the enlisted members erupt in laughter. What now, lieutenant?
            </p> <br />

            <p>Possible actions:<br /><br />
            (A) Laugh along with the enlisted members. Despite rendering the appropriate customs to the captain, it's unimportant to correct the enlisted members.<br />
            (B) Call for a meeting with the squadron commander to explain the substandard conduct of the enlisted members.<br />
            (C) Make an on the spot correction to the enlisted members. Emphasize how the salute is a courteous exchange of greetings showing mutual respect between
            members of the armed forces.<br />
            (D) Ask to get to know each of the enlisted members personally to understand their behavior.</p><br />

            <h2>Scenario 2 - Airmen's Needs</h2>
            <p>You are the squadron commander at your newest unit at Ramstein AFB - Germany. Your airmen count on you to be a leader and provide them with guidance and resources to succeed.
                One of your subordinates - Staff Sergeant Smith - informs you of his wife - who is pregnant, days away from giving birth to their child back in the U.S.
                Sergeant Smith requests temporary leave to witness the birth of his child. How do you respond?
            </p><br />
            <p>Possible actions:<br /><br />
            (A) Delegate the decision to your superior<br />
            (B) Listen intently to the sergeant. Devise a plan of action, working with both your subordinate and superior officers, to make an accomodation for the sergeant to see the birth of
            his child.<br />
            (C) Respectfully tell the sergeant that you cannot honor his request; military service often takes precedence over the personal matters
            of an individual.<br />
            (D) Call for a wing staff meeting regarding this matter.</p><br />
